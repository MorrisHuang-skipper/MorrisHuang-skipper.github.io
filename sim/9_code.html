                The following code is about how to simulate the eletric field and potential of a dipole.<br>
                You can also view the complete code here(<a href='9_full_code.html'>full code</a>).<br>
                Below is the explanation of the code that divided into different section.<br><br>
                --> First you need to import vpython.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/8149e9003eba539f4f406af14b7cddcf.js"></script><br>
                --> Then setting some important parameter.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/926b08f433bdc1a0c8a48623dc3e9334.js"></script><br>
                --> Now come to the main function which will be execute at the end.<br>
                --> Main function is pretty straight forword, first create a scene that set userspin, userpan and userzoom to False
                that desable scene to spin, pan and zoom.<br>
                --> Then create a dipole that use the class 'Charge' that will explain later.<br>
                --> Finally create field and potnetial using function in the class 'Charge'.<br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/c3aab3d666c8ec64eac3291c926d3d15.js"></script><br>
                --> Create a class 'Charge' that handle the attribute and the method regarding of charges. 
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/4618ca96590a8c3e5944710263df6387.js"></script><br>
                --> Initialize charge class that create sphere at a given position.<br>
                --> Store the information of charge(position and charge of eletron) in variable info, info[0] and info[1] representing
                the position of the charge and the coulommb for the charge repectively.<br>
                --> Red and blue represent negative and positive charge respectively<br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/1e6995f54c22640fd186e2fcddc5bfcf.js"></script><br>
                --> Create field in the given range and set the default interval be the radius of the charge.<br>
                --> Using for loop that create arrow wihtin the meshgrid.<br>
                --> Using try-except syntax that prevent the error occured at the surface of the charge.<br>
                --> Use function <i>field_color</i> that determine the color of the arrow at the given position that represent the magnitude of
                the eletric field.<br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/bea0d5be733335826b41dc5a662aa28e.js"></script><br>
                --> Similarly create eletric potnetial in the given range using object 'quad' from vpython.<br>
                --> Using for loop that create quad wihtin the meshgrid.<br>
                --> Using try-except syntax that prevent the error occured at the surface of the charge.<br>
                --> Use function <i>potential_color</i> that determine the color of the quad at the given position that represent the magnitude of
                the eletric potential.<br>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/f1387ba30905701e748303784ef63006.js"></script><br>
                --> By taking logarithm to normalize the magnitude of the eletric field to (0, 1), so it can be used for mapping the color.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/74bd24832f4f1c6e9544110cd6148beb.js"></script><br>
                --> Similary taking logarithm to normalize the magnitude of the eletric potential to (0, 1) but only with different coefficient, so
                it can be used for mapping the color.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/bb7b5dd4549eba03781bce2c95275300.js"></script><br>
                --> By using above normalized value the following two function that use these value to create a vector of color that deternine the
                color of arrow and quad object that representing the strenght of field and potential.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/0139d83628f70cf7b88181ec3674cd3a.js"></script>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/0f7e21ecc2ef5f4d35b6d263721f852e.js"></script><br>
                --> Using vpython object 'quad' that takes four vertex as input and create a quad with unique color that represent eletirc potential strength.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/cd9ee640231ebbd199c74c017f632fe3.js"></script><br>
                --> This function return a list of meshgrid that can be use to create eletric field and eletric potential.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/1a5dea2139c6f0067dc476143757b50c.js"></script><br>
                --> Since python built-in function 'range' cannot create a list that the intreval is a floating number, the following function solved this problem.
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/MorrisHuang-skipper/ad3e9d57b6757f62c9e5e8af1b33c502.js"></script><br>
                --> Finally execute the main function.
