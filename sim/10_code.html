                --> The following code is about how to simulate charge motion near a dipole.<br>
                --> You can also view the complete code here(<a href='10_full_code.html'>full code</a>).<br>
                --> Below is the explanation of the code that divided into different section.<br><br>
                --> Most of the function appear in this program is the same in <a href='9_code.html'>eletric field and potential of a dipole</a>, only add one extra funciton.<br>
                --> First you need to import vpython.

                --> Then setting some important parameter.

                --> Now come to the main function which will be execute at the end. Only slightly different from <a href='9_code.html'>eletric field and potential of a dipole</a>.<br>
                --> But only this time we don't calulate eletric potential, otherwise it will occpied too many memory.<br>
                --> Create a free charge with initial position and velovity can be customize.<br>
                --> Finally using function 'update' that will update the position of free charge.<br>

                --> This is the only function that been added in this program from <a href='9_code.html'>this program</a>.<br>
                --> This function takes two input: one is free charge and the other is a list of dipole(or other sorce of eletric field). Use these two input to calculate the force that exert on free charge, and the accelaration of free charge.<br>

                --> Finally execute the main function.
